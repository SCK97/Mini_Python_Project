# Mini_Python_Project

GitBash Restaurant offers users the chance to order their favourite Python foods through the terminal (GitBash preferred).

Customers are prompted to enter their name, and are then provided with the 4 main options available to them:
  - View the Menu
  - View their Basket
  - Give Feedback
  - Exit GitBash Restaurant (not reccommended, no other establishment does Python themed fine dining)
GitBash Restaurant automatically understands customers whether they use upper or lower case
However, if customers use words not related to one of the 4 options provided to them, GB will not understand and will prompt the user to begin again

Menu:
Various Python related fine dining dishes are printed to the screen
Customers can add one or more of these items to their meal, and then navigate to the basket to view this
When a customer requests a dish not on the menu, GB will inform the customer that they are all out
GB Restaurant has high standards to maintain and expects their customers to use capitalization as appropriate regarding menu items
If the customer finds this to be a frustrating experience, they can Exit GB Restaurant through the menu

Basket:
Customers can view the various dishes that make up thier meal, alongside the relevant prices
The basket will show the user the total price of their meal, and ask them if they would like to pay
If a customer overlooked the menu price and is appalled by the cost of Python themed fine dining, they can exit GB Restaurant through the basket

Feedback:
Customers are given space to tell GB Restaurant how they could improve (though this is seldom used as GB Restaurant are a top tier establishment, and therefore have little need to actually record and store this information)
They can then exit GB Restaurant, or restart their experience

Exit:
Says goodbye to customers as they leave GitBash Restaurant
